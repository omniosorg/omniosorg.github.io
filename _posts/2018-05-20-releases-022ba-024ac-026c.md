OmniOS Community Edition releases
r151026c, r151024ac & r151022ba
are now available.

Weekly releases for w/c 21st of May 2018.

* Curl has been updated to version 7.60.0 on all releases, fixing two
  CVEs.

* For r151026, dma - the Dragonfly Mail Agent - has been updated so that it
  strips header lines that begin with the five-character sequence _"From "_.
  This is the default behaviour of other MTAs such as Sendmail. This fixes a
  problem with processing emails generated by cron or by other users of the
  `mail` command where message headers end up as part of the body.
