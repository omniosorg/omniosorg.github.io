`uname -a` shows omnios-r151022-f9693432c2 (no change in this release) 

Our work does not stop here though.  First we are committed to quickly
releasing updates for r151022 as the need arises.  We are also working
towards releasing r151024 on schedule.  To that end, we have already updated
the bloody environment with all the latest goodies from upstream illumos and
joyent-lx repositories.
