---
OmniOS Community Edition weekly releases for w/c 20th of May 2019 are
now available.
> These updates require a reboot.

The following updates are available for **all supported releases**:

# Security Fixes

* Mitigations for a series of CPU side channel vulnerabilities that affect
  Intel CPUs. These are collectively known as multi-architectural data
  sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities and cover the following CVEs:
  * [CVE-2018-12126](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12126)
  * [CVE-2018-12127](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12127)
  * [CVE-2018-12130](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12130)
  * [CVE-2019-11091](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11091)

  For more information, refer to the [Intel security advisory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00233.html)

* Intel CPU microcode has been updated to the 20190514 release.

# Other Changes

* New feature allowing hyperthreading to be disabled on a running system or
  at boot time. To disable on an active system use `psradm -aS` and to disable
  at every boot `echo smt_enabled=false > /boot/conf.d/smt`
  [illumos 11048](https://www.illumos.org/issues/11048)

* The `mdb -ke ::sec` command has been updated to cover the new MDS
  vulnerabilities.

* It is now possible to configure the desired behaviour in response to receipt
  of an NMI via a boot option in place of `/etc/system`. For example, to
  cause a panic, `echo nmi=panic > /boot/conf.d/nmi`. Other options are
  _kmdb_ and _ignore_ (the default).

* The `cpuid` utility has been updated to show whether the processor supports
  the new *MD\_CLEAR* feature (delivered via microcode update).

Additionally, for **r151030** only:

* TCP wrapper support for OpenSSH has been restored.
