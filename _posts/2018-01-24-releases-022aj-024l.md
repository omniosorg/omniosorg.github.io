> No reboot required.

Both updates include the following **security fixes**:

* `bind` updated to 9.10.6-P1:
  * [CVE-2017-3145](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-3145)
* `curl` updated to 7.58.0
  * [CVE-2018-1000005](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-824a.html)
  * [CVE-2018-1000007](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-b3bf.html)

The `cpuid` utility has also been updated and can now report on support for
the new speculation control and branch predictor instructions added via
Intel microcode updates.
```
# cpuid | egrep 'IBRS|STI'
  Speculation Control (IBRS and IBPB)
  Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictors (STIBP)
```

There are some backported fixes which have not been published to the
IPS repositories as they correct rarely seen problems and would force a reboot.
These are:

* Extended attribute kernel panic - [illumos issue 8969](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8969)
* IPv6 multicast-related kernel panic - [illumos issue 8653](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8653) - available for r151024 only.

Downloadable hot-fix files have been made available for these issues; refer to
the [release notes](/releasenotes.html) for further information.

Finally, support for booting from a RAIDZ2 or RAIDZ3 pool has been added to
r151024 and new installation media have been produced and are available on
the download page.
