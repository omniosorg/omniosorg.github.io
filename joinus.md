# Contribute to OmniOS

OmniOS Community Edition has no major company behind it, just a small team of
people who spend their precious spare time keeping it up-to-date. If you rely
on OmniOS for fun or business, and you want to help secure its future, you can
contribute in a variety of ways.

# Developers Wanted

We are always on the look-out for people to join the OmniOS development team.
Don't worry if you don't have a lot of experience, there are a variety of
different tasks and all we ask is that you are willing to put some time in
and learn as you go! If you want to get involved, please
[get in touch](/about/contact.html).
If you aren't a programmer we also need help with maintaining the web site
and creating documentation, see below.

Tasks include:

* Weekly merging of upstream changes from ilumos-gate and illumos-joyent;
* Keeping core software up-to-date;
* Developing new features;
* Building and testing releases;
* Responding to bug reports and issues;
* Integrating local changes back to upstream illumos-gate;
* Defining the roadmap for future releases;
* Improving the interactive installer;
* etc...

If you want to find out more about some of the work that was involved in

# Extra package repository

The
[OmniOS Extra](https://pkg.omniosce.org/{{site.omnios_stable}}/extra/en/catalog.shtml)
package repository contains a small number of commonly used additional
packages such as _nginx_ and _postfix_. We'd appreciate contributions in this
area so if there's some software you use on OmniOS and would be useful to
others, why not get involved and submit a package to _omnios-extra_?

# Non-programmer Tasks

If you aren't a programmer, we would also appreciate help with maintaining the
web site and documentation for OmniOS, preparing release notes and guides for
new users, etc. Please [get in touch](/about/contact.html) if you're able to
help in any of these areas.

# Donate

If you aren't able to help in the above areas, please consider
[donating to OmniOS](/patron.html).
We are committed to providing updates to OmniOS for many years to come and
to maintaining the stable and long-term-release models put in place by
OmniTI before us. Your donation will help us to achieve that goal and
ensure the long-term success of OmniOSce.

We also provide [support contracts](/invoice.html) if you need cover for your
systems.
