On April 21st 2017, [Robert Treat announced](https://omnios.org/ml-archive/2017-April/008699.html)
that OmniTI would suspend active development of OmniOS and support
contracts would not be renewed.  After five years of releases twice
a year, OmniOS had become highly popular, yet a goal of making
OmniOS community operated had not been realized.

While the announcement of this "radical" approach [stunned many](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/25/oracle_free_solaris_project_stops/),
Treat explained that the action was taken in part in hopes that it
might catalyze the community, stating "To be clear, our goal is not to abandon
OmniOS, but to divest OmniTI from the open source project in order to spur
others to participate more."

14 weeks later, OmniOS Community Edition is a reality.

Andy Fiddaman ([www.citrus-it.net](https://www.citrus-it.net)), Tobias
Oetiker ([www.oetiker.ch](https://www.oetiker.ch)) and Dominik Hassler have
spent some quality time setting up the systems and procedures allowing us to
take over maintenance and development of OmniOS.

In this endeavor we were
supported by many.  Special thanks to
Stefan Husch ([www.qutic.com](https://www.qutic.com)),
Peter Tribble ([www.petertribble.co.uk](https://www.petertribble.co.uk)),
Dan McDonald ([kebe.com](http://kebe.com/~danmcd/))
and
Theo Schlossnagle ([www.circonus.com](https://www.circonus.com)).

A big thank you also to the [Integrated Systems Laboratory](http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch)
of ETH Zurich, Switzerland, who have graciously provided a zone on one of
their OmniOS boxes to host our new repository.
