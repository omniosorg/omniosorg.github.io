# Become a Patron of OmniOS Community Edition

OmniOS Community Edition implicates that there is no major company behind
it, but a bunch of people who spend their precious spare time keeping it up
to date. If you are relying on OmniOS for fun or business, and you want to
help secure its future, you can either join us and start contributing your
time, or you can become an OmniOS Patron.

We use the money provided by our patrons to pay for any services we use in
publishing and maintaining OmniOS. The rest of the money gets divided up
and distributed among the core contributors according to the amount of time
they put into the project. Ultimately the board of the OmniOSce Association
decides about the use of the money.
