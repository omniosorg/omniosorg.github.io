On April 21st 2017, OmniTI announced that they would suspend active
development of OmniOS and support contracts would not be renewed.


While this announcement left many users stunned, others focused more on the
fact that OmniTI in their announcement also expressed the hope that "the
community" would take up further development of the OS.  14 weeks later,
OmniOS Community Edition is a reality.

Andy Fiddaman ([www.citrus-it.net](https://www.citrus-it.net)), Tobias
Oetiker ([www.oetiker.ch](https://www.oetiker.ch)) and Dominik Hassler have
spent some quality time setting up the systems and procedures allowing us to
take over maintenance and development of OmniOS.  

In this endeavour we were
supported by many.  Special thanks to Stefan Husch
([www.qutic.com](https://www.qutic.com)), Peter Tribble
([www.petertribble.co.uk](https://www.petertribble.co.uk)), Dan McDonald and
Theo Schlossnagle ([www.circonus.com](https://www.circonus.com)).

A big thank you also to the [Integrated Systems Laboratory](http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch)
of ETH Zurich, Switzerland, who have graceously provided a zone on one of
their OmniOS boxes to host our new repository.
