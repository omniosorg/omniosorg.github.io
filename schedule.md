# OmniOS Release Schedule

Even-numbered releases of OmniOS are stable and odd-numbered releases are
unstable (bloody). See [stable vs. bloody](/about/stablevsbloody.html) for
more information on the difference between them.

Stable releases come out approximately every six months; around the first week
in May and the first week in November. Stable releases are supported
for a year after release.

Every fourth stable release is a long-term support (LTS) release. **LTS
releases are supported for three years** and therefore overlap for a year to
allow time for validation and upgrade even in complex environments. Regular
stable releases overlap for six months.
